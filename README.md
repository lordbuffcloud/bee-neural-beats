# Bee Neural Beats üêùüß†

A sophisticated binaural beats generator for meditation, focus, and consciousness exploration. Harness the power of brainwave entrainment through carefully crafted audio frequencies.

## Features

- **Frequency Band Selection**: Choose from Delta, Theta, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma brainwave frequencies
- **Manual Controls**: Fine-tune carrier frequency, beat frequency, and volume
- **Preset Modes**: Quick access to meditation, focus, sleep aid, and creativity boost settings
- **Real-time Visualization**: Live waveform display showing audio patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Beautiful golden-themed interface optimized for all devices

## Frequency Bands

- **Delta (1-4 Hz)**: Deep restorative state, borderline sleep ‚Äî useful for regeneration, shielding, subconscious imprinting
- **Theta (4-8 Hz)**: Deep meditative/liminal states, between waking and sleep: perfect for Hermetic/Chaos rituals, connecting with deeper self
- **Alpha (8-13 Hz)**: Relaxed focus, visualization, manifestation work from a calm yet alert mind
- **Beta (12-30 Hz)**: Alert, cognitive, creative peaks ‚Äî useful when coding, engineering, high flow state
- **Gamma (30-100 Hz)**: Peak consciousness, spiritual awareness, enhanced perception

## Usage

1. Select a frequency band or use manual controls
2. Adjust volume to comfortable levels
3. Click Play to start the binaural beats
4. Use headphones for optimal stereo effect

## Technology

- **Web Audio API**: High-quality audio generation
- **Canvas API**: Real-time waveform visualization
- **Modern CSS**: Responsive grid layout with golden theme
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: No frameworks, pure performance
